/*
 * GameSDK — portable portal bridge, core
 * ======================================
 *
 * Load this file FIRST, then exactly ONE platform adapter:
 *
 *   <script src="js/sdk-core.js"></script>
 *   <script src="js/platform-crazygames.js"></script>   <!-- or -youtube / -yandex -->
 *
 * Never ship two adapters in one build. Beyond the wasted bytes, YouTube
 * Playables certification greps the whole bundle AS TEXT, so the CrazyGames
 * adapter's browser-storage and browser-locale references would flag a
 * Playables build even though that code could never run there.
 *
 * THIS FILE SHIPS IN EVERY BUNDLE, INCLUDING YOUTUBE. It must therefore never
 * name a banned browser API — the persistent storage ones, the page visibility
 * ones, or the navigator locale properties — in code OR in a comment. The scan
 * reads text and cannot tell the two apart. See platform-youtube.js.
 *
 * WHAT LIVES HERE
 * ---------------
 * Everything that is identical on every portal: the interface, the capability
 * map, config, and the ad orchestration (dedupe, both watchdogs, settle-once,
 * gameplay bracketing). Adapters implement `_requestAd(type, hooks)` and the
 * platform calls — never the flow control. Portals fire duplicate callbacks and
 * drop callbacks entirely; that has to be handled in one audited place.
 *
 * WHAT THIS LAYER NEVER DOES
 * --------------------------
 * Touch the DOM, inject CSS, own a colour, or know a game. Ad transitions,
 * pausing and muting belong to the game — the bridge only says WHEN.
 *
 * CONTRACTS THAT HOLD ON EVERY PLATFORM
 * -------------------------------------
 *  - init() never rejects and never hangs. A dead portal still boots the game.
 *  - showAd() settles EXACTLY ONCE, always, even if the portal never answers.
 *  - A rewarded ad that did not genuinely play NEVER calls onFinished.
 *  - getLanguage() returns a Promise (YouTube's is async, so all of them are —
 *    otherwise the return type changes per platform and callers break only
 *    there, in the one environment that is hardest to debug).
 *  - Key-value storage is in-memory by default (YouTube Playables forbids every
 *    browser persistence mechanism); adapters override upward to cloud storage.
 *
 * USAGE
 * -----
 *   GameSDK.configure({ gameKey: 'mygame' });
 *   await GameSDK.init();
 *   GameSDK.loadingStart();
 *   ...load...
 *   GameSDK.firstFrameReady();
 *   GameSDK.loadingStop();
 *
 * Methods a platform doesn't support are safe no-ops, so game code never needs
 * to guard a call. `supports()` exists to hide UI that would be a dead button:
 *
 *   if (GameSDK.supports('leaderboard')) showLeaderboardButton();
 *
 * DEV
 * ---
 *   ?sdk=mock         force the mock adapter (alias: ?sdk=local)
 *   ?sdk=real         force the real adapter on localhost
 * Off localhost the real adapter is ALWAYS chosen. Falling back to a mock in
 * production would hand out every rewarded prize for free and write saves to
 * the wrong place.
